							<h1>The Journey to Indenture</h1>
								<p>﻿Between 1771 and 1773, in the midst of the American Revolution, over five thousand people were recorded as entering into contracts of indenture at the Port of Philadelphia. How did they travel to Philadelphia?  And where did they come from?<sup>1</sup></p>

								<hr />

								<p>Most people arrived by ship, traveling across the Atlantic, as shown in the map below, in search of a better life than they had at home. Others came from Philadelphia itself, voluntarily entering into <a data-fancybox data-type="ajax" data-slide-class="tooltip" data-src="https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/ind17711773/resources.html" data-filter="#indenturecontract" href="javascript:;">indenture contracts</a> or through coercion.  Children were recruited from House of Employment and forced to serve lengthy periods of servitude.</p>

							<h2>The Story of John Dobbs</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><a data-fancybox="group-1" data-caption="Text transcription: 'John Dobbs (1772, October 12th) Who declares himself twenty one year of age upwards and a free man.  Bound as apprentice to William Logan of St Eustatia House Carpenter & Joiner, four years, to be taught the House Carpenter & Joiners trade, and at the Exiprat of his term to give him a sett of bench tools new, and one compleat new suit of apparel besides his old, or five pounds laful money of Pennsylvania in lieu of the clothes which said apprentice may choose.'" href="images/dobbs.jpg" title="Click here to examine the record of John Dobbs.">

								<!--Hidden Gallery Images--><a data-fancybox="group-1" data-caption="The full page (p. 261) on which John Dobbs' indenture contract appears in the Record of Indentures." title="Page 261 of the Record of Indentures, including John Dobbs' record." href="images/dobbs-full.jpg" style="display:none;"></a>On October 12th, 1772, John Dobbs signed a contract of indenture with William Logan. He was to be <a data-fancybox data-type="ajax" data-slide-class="tooltip" data-src="https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/ind17711773/resources.html" data-filter="#apprenticeship" href="javascript:;">apprenticed</a> for four years during which time he would learn "the house carpenter and joiners trade". What was unusual about Dobbs' story is that his apprenticeship would be spent on an island in the Caribbean referred to as St. Eustatia, commonly known as St. Eustatius.<sup>2</sup></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><a title="St. Eustatius" data-fancybox href="images/eustache.jpg" data-caption="This engraving, 'St. Eustache une des Isles d'Antilles dans l'Amerique du Nord,' shows the busy harbor of the island of St. Eustache in the Caribbean as it appeared in the 18th century, when John Dobbs worked there."><img src="images/eustache-1.jpg" alt="A colored engraving showing many ships in the harbor of the island of St. Eustache as it appeared in the 18th century."/><caption><em>Engraving of St. Eustasius</em></caption></span></a>This small island was critical, in terms of trade, for the US since the 1680s.  Initially the island housed plantations, however the lack of fresh water made these difficult to sustain and it soon became a center for commerce. By 1770, Dutch tea was regularly shipped to St. Eustatius, repackaged and sent onwards to America.<sup>3</sup>  The island had therefore become one of the busiest ports in the Americas. Records show that a large portion of the island's inhabitants were involved in supporting the shipping trade as "porters, joiners, coopers” and more.  Dobbs’ apprenticeship would have been a valuable source of labor for merchants engaged in trade in this busy port.</p>
								<p>When Dobbs' contract of indenture expired, he was to be given <i>"a sett of bench tools new, and one compleat new suit of apparel besides his old, or five pounds laful money of Pa. in lieu of the clothes which said apprentice may choose."</i> The provision of these goods - tools, clothes or a sum of money - was a legal requirement.  These were called ‘freedom dues’ and were only paid upon completion of contracts thus acting as an incentive to serve its full term.<sup>4</sup></p>

												<li><sup><b>1. Data note:</b>  We made several decisions when processing this data.  First, we entered decimal latitude and longitude coordinates to the center of the smallest known geographical location (town, county, country). The maps depicting the movement of people to American is comprised only of records where we know the point of departure and location of bondage.  This is approximately 2,000 records from a total of over 5,000.  The sample on this map is thus not representative of the whole.<sup></li>
