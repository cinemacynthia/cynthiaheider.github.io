							<h1>About This Data</h1>

							<p>For this exhibit we have focused on three main 'themes' of analysis - location, gender, and time. Of course, there are many other ways to analyze the data and we encourage you to do so. To this end, we have uploaded the dataset to our website for you to download and try yourselves.</p>

							<h2>Where has this data come from?</h2>
								<p>Over a two year period, staff at the American Philosophical Society digitized and <a data-fancybox data-type="ajax" data-slide-class="tooltip" data-src="https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/ind17711773/resources.html" data-filter="#transcription" href="javascript:;">transcribed</a> the bound volume of records creating a large <a data-fancybox data-type="ajax" data-slide-class="tooltip" data-src="https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/ind17711773/resources.html" data-filter="#dataset" href="javascript:;">dataset</a>.  This data can be <a data-fancybox data-type="ajax" data-slide-class="tooltip" data-src="https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/ind17711773/resources.html" data-filter="#visualization" href="javascript:;">visualized</a> in many ways.  Each map, graph, and diagram can be used in data stories that tell us about those who were indentured.</p>
								<p>There are over 5,139 entries in the "Record of indentures of individuals bound out as apprentices, servants, etc., and of German and other redemptioners, 1771 October 3 - 1773 October 5" volume. Having all of these records in spreadsheet form means that instead of reading over six hundred pages of handwritten text, we can now analyze two years’ worth of records quickly and by different measures.</p>


							<p>Data are not objective. When we create data sets, we make many decisions about what to include, what to leave out, how to categorize words or locations and more. We view historic data through a contemporary lens.</p>
							<p>The records of indentured servitude, when viewed as data, create distance from the practice that they describe. Entering into a contract of indenture likely meant a difficult life for the indentured person. This volume contains snapshots of critical points in the lives of thousands of individuals. While examining the visualizations produced from this dataset allows us to highlight unique individual stories, it can also hide many others that become lost in numbers and statistics.</p>
							
							<h2>Is there anything the data doesn’t show?</h2>
								<p>﻿By looking at the dataset as a whole, we see only the big picture.  It can be easy to forget about the details and thus the people behind the records.  Contracts of indenture tell us about a critical part of their lives, but not the whole story.  Reducing human experience to data can obscure the emotional and full lives of each individual.  For example, how did families feel when they were forced to sign contracts of indenture that would split them by household or location?  How did new mothers complete their contracts with newborns to care for?</p>
								<p>We have tried to show both views of this data by presenting individual stories alongside visualizations.  However, there is much lost in the space between the small and large scale.  It is also important to remember that when we build visualizations, we have feelings about the data we are presenting and might be predisposed to present them in a way that is sympathetic to these.  This is another reason why it is important to be transparent about how and why we build and design visualizations.</p>
							
						<br />
							<h2>About data transparency at APS</h2>
								<p>The American Philosophical Society Library & Museum maintains an active Open Data Initiative. Under this initiative, the Center for Digital Scholarship (1) identifies content in the APS Library that is conducive to being reconfigured as structured datasets; (2) encourages the use and reuse of the data by opening the data to all, and by easing access to the data.</p><p>Recognizing that the processes of data collection, organization, interpretation, and visualization have the potential to enact, reify, or reinforce cultural and structural harms, biases, and inequalities, the CDS endorses a policy of data transparency. Due to the quantitative demands of computational analysis methods, even well-intentioned and careful data work may misrepresent the nuance, complexity, and uncertainty inherent in human lives and experiences. A responsibly humanistic approach to data therefore requires transparency around method and labor, as well as a critical assessment of the data’s uncertainties, biases, and limitations.</p>
