							<h1>The Inventor</h1>
							<p>Born in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania in 1913, Chance came from a family with a rich engineering background. His grandfather, Henry Martyn Chance, authored the Second Geological Survey of the State of Pennsylvania which was largely focused on the coal and petroleum resources of the state. His father, Edwin Chance, invented a device that used chemical reactions to detect carbon monoxide in coal mines. The Chance family spent summers on the New Jersey shore and were avid sailors, introducing Britton to sailing at a young age. It would continue to be an important aspect throughout his long life. Drawing on his family's engineering aptitude, as a young man Chance designed and developed a new device to automatically steer ships. He was later hired by British General Electric to test his device on a round trip voyage to New Zealand in the late 1930s. Chance's automatic steering device was awarded a patent in 1937, the first of many that he would obtain throughout his career. Below are links to images and documents that represent this formative period of Chance's life.</P>
